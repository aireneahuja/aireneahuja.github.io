    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am currently a grade 12 student and my main focuses in school include
        computer science, physics, and mathematics. As such, I intend on majoring
        in physics and computer science in university. I also have a passion for
        social justice! I want to change the world for the better and do my part
        in creating a more equitable world for everyone. I am always looking to
        incorporate all these things in my life in various ways.<p/>

    <h3>Why Physics and Computer Science?</h3>
    <p>I've always loved solving problems and thinking with both logic and
      creativity to make that happen came easily to me. The questions found in
      both of these subjects allow me to apply these skills and challenge myself
      in different ways. I also love how physics can be used to explain and better
      understand so much of the world around us, and how computer science can be
      used in just about everything to make it more accesible.</p>

    <h3>Applying My Passions</h3>
    <p>I am involved in a lot of different things that allow me to apply my
      interests. I am a Math Challengers Coach, and I have been for the past two
      years. This involves teaching younger students and encourage them to
      challenge themselves through the subject. As a Physics Club executive, I
      help inspire a love of physics through fun projects and helping teach the
      rather interesting parts of it that aren't covered in regular courses</p>
    <p>This is also my third year as a leader in the Gender-Sexuality Alliance.
      This club has provided an amazing oppurtunity for me to create a safe-space
      and be someone for younger students to look up to. The Dragons for Justice
      club gives me a space to work on creating change and equality, while making
      it accesible to everyone. Overall, I love being involved and expressing my
      interests in my community and beyond.</p>

    <h3>In My Free Time</h3>
    <p>One of my main hobbies is improving my programming skills through challenge
      problems and starting small projects. I like to challenge my mind and I have
      found that the best ideas come from free time and just spending some time
      on my laptop. I also love reading, and although I will read just about anything,
      I come back to a few genres time and time again. I love non-fiction astronomy books
      because anything to do with the universe, all of the weird and wonderful
      things that we don't completely understand yet, is incredibly interesting
      to me. Science fiction is also amazing because the books that authors,
      especially those with scientific backgrounds, write by incorporating science
      into their imaginations, are always a pleasure to read. While I don't get
      much free time for my hobbies at the moment, one of my goals is to make more
      time for the things I love!</p>
